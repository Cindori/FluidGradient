A fluid, animated gradient implemented with CoreAnimation and SwiftUI, made available as a [Swift Package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).

## How it works

This implementation works by displaying stacked "blobs" in a coordinate space, and blurring them afterwards to make it seem seamless. The blobs are simple `CAGradientLayer` layers added to two separate `CALayer` layers: base and highlight. The latter one has an overlay blend mode to create unique patterns. You can optionally provide colors for both the base and highlight layers.

## Example usage

You can find an example buildable project that uses FluidGradient in the root of this repository. To use it in your app, you can start with the following:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import FluidGradient

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        FluidGradient(blobs: [.red, .green, .blue],
                      highlights: [.yellow, .orange, .purple],
                      speed: 1.0,
                      blur: 0.75)
          .background(.quaternary)
    }
}
```
